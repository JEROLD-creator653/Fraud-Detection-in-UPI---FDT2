#Issues in Project

1. The chatbot is not able to explain a transaction when given its Id.
   - STATUS: RESOLVED ✓

2. In react app, the actions done by admin is not reflected in the recent transactions but it is reflected in the transaction history page
   - STATUS: RESOLVED ✓ (verified end-to-end)

3. (Backend Startup Issue - FIXED) 
   - Problem: Server was stuck during startup due to async redis_pubsub_listener blocking
   - Fix: Converted async listener to synchronous and run in background thread
   - File: /backend/server.py:145-175, 350-356
   - STATUS: RESOLVED ✓
   - Verification: Server now starts and initializes all components successfully

4. Chatbot returns "Sorry, I encountered an error" when asking about database data
   - Problem: Query results contained datetime and Decimal objects that couldn't be JSON serialized
   - Error: "Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable" → then "Object of type Decimal is not JSON serializable"
   - Fix: Added _convert_datetime_objects() helper method in FraudDetectionChatbot class
     - Recursively converts datetime objects to ISO format strings
     - Converts Decimal objects to floats
     - Applied conversion to sql_results before returning from chat() method
   - File: /app/chatbot.py:506-557
   - STATUS: RESOLVED ✓
   - Verification: Tested with queries like "Show me blocked transactions", "How many transactions total?", "What is average risk score?" - all working
